## 🎯 What I Learned  
This project helped me strengthen my understanding of key JavaScript concepts, including:  
✅ **Randomization** – generating a random choice for the computer  
✅ **Event listeners** – capturing user input when a choice is made  
✅ **DOM manipulation** – updating scores and messages dynamically  
✅ **Conditional logic** – determining the winner based on game rules  
✅ **CSS Hover Effects** – enhancing user interaction with smooth transitions  
✅ **Flexbox** – designing a responsive layout that works across devices  

I also focused on making the UI more engaging with **real-time score updates** and **color changes** based on the result. 🎨
